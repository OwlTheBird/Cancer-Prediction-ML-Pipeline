# Cancer Prediction

A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for cancer prediction.  
It covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and model export.

## Features
- Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (plots, correlations)
- Feature selection by correlation threshold
- Model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree)
- Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Hyperparameters Tunning with GridSearchCV (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Model export with `joblib`
